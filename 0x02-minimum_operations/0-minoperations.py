    Interview preparation exercise: Minimum Operations

    Problem description:

    In a text file, there is a single character H. Your text editor can
    execute only two operations in this file: Copy All and Paste. Given
    a number n, write a method that calculates the fewest number of operations
    needed to result in exactly n H characters in the file.

    Prototype: def minOperations(n)
    Returns an integer
    If n is impossible to achieve, return 0
    Example:

    n = 9

    H => Copy All => Paste => HH => Paste =>HHH => Copy All
    => Paste => HHHHHH => Paste => HHHHHHHHH

    Number of operations: 6
